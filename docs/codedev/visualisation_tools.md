# Visualisation tools

During the course we will introduce several tools that are useful to visualise and explore astronomical data. Those tools cannot be run in the web-based system of your JupyterHub environment. Fortunately, the main tools we will use are available for a variety of platforms and operating systems and you should be able to use them in your local machine without major installation issues.

## SAO Image DS9

DS9 is a powerful tool for displaying astronomical images (also data cubes and spectra) from FITS files. It also allows limited by convenient interactive analysis of the data.

DS9 can be downloaded for a range of platforms from its [website](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9/download?authuser=0). After you have downloaded the version for your operating system, go ahead an install it, following the website instructions if necessary. After opening it you should see a blank window

You can now open a FITS image (for example, try downloading [this one](https://faculty.washington.edu/gallegoj/astr480/673nmos.fits)) and you should get something like this

For more detail on how to use DS9 refer to its [User Manual](https://ds9.si.edu/doc/user/gui/index.html).

## TOPCAT

[TOPCAT](https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat) is an application that allows to work with tabular data in many formats, as well as filtering, plotting, and cross-matching data. It can be installed in any system with a working Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

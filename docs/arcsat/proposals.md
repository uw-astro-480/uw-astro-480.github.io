# ARCSAT proposals

## Ideas for proposals

Here are a few very broad ideas for proposals that you can use as a starting point. You are encouraged to come up with your own ideas, but if you are stuck, these can help you get started.

- Eclipsing exoplanet transit light curve (determine period and other orbital parameters).
- Cataclysmic or short period variable star light curve (ditto).
- Radial profiles of elliptical vs spiral galaxies.
- Estimate star formation rate from continuum-subtracted H-alpha imaging.
- Extragalactic SN observations.
- Observations of asteroids/comets. Determine orbital parameters.
- ...

## Pre-proposals

Before you start working on your final proposal we ask you that you send us a few lines (no more than 2-3 paragraphs) describing your idea and some example targets that you're planning to observe. Based on this we may suggest some changes to your proposal, especially if it does not seem doable with the ARCSAT telescope and instrumentation. The pre-proposal is due on **Friday, April 18**.

A few things that your pre-proposal should touch on, but very briefly:

- What do you want to observe?
- What targets? No need to be very specific at this point, but at least specify the type, class, and magnitude of the targets that you are considering.
- What exposure times do you expect to need? What filters?
- Can you reach the target magnitude and obtain the necessary S/N?
- What analysis do you plan to do on the data and what is the final goal of your study?

As soon as you have formed your team, please edit [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17P4cy8S05K8lP4w2lT4szxyHeMYlc1kBuU4sWxj8Cdc/edit?usp=sharing) with the names of your team members (and optionally a team name!) Team should be limited to 3-4 students.

When you are ready to submit your pre-proposal, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOSuVRKy1lKyV5XAR5803X98K68tNaPIfsRTFeeZbAWbW0Jg/viewform?usp=sharing).

## Full proposals

Details about the content of the full proposal will be provided soon. The full proposals are due on **Monday, May 5**.

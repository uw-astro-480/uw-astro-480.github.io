# Introductory concepts

This section covers a series of introductory concepts that are important for the course and for observational astronomy in general. It is not intended to be thoroughly exhaustive, but rather to provide a basic understanding of the topics that will be covered in more detail later in the course. Further reading is provided at the end of the section and as links throughout the text.

## Coordinate systems

Anybody who has spent some time looking at the sky in a dark place at night will notice that the stars, planets, and other astronomical objects seem to be arranged on the "surface" of a sphere that rotates around a point. If we take a long-exposure photograph centred around that "celestial pole" we will see that the stars move in arcs.

Of course, we understand why this is happening: the sky rotates as a result of the rotation of the Earth, with the Earth's axis of rotation —when projected on the sky— defining the point where the celestial sphere rotates around. And the stars are not all really on the same plane, but rather at different distances from us. But those distances are so vast that perspective renders them all on a what appears to be a single surface.

That said, it is convenient for many purposes to think of the sky as a sphere that rotates around a given axis, and the celestial objects being placed on that sphere.

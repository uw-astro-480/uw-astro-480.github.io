## Course description

ASTR 481 provides a practical, comprehensive introduction to astronomical data analysis and observing techniques. These skills are essential not only to plan and carry out your own astronomical observations but to work with archival data. In this course you will learn:

- The basics of telescope optics, cameras, coordinate systems, and other observational tools.
- How CCD cameras work and how to reduce and calibrate CCD data.
- How to prepare observing proposals and use telescopes.
- How to carry out your own remote observations using a professional telescope.
- How to work with catalogue data and databases.
- How to visualise and plot data.
- How to reduce and calibrate spectroscopic data.
- How to present your observational results as a scientific paper.

The highlight of the course are the observations that you will be able to carry out using the [ARCSAT](https://www.apo.nmsu.edu/Telescopes/ARCSAT/) telescope at Apache Point Observatory. As part of the course you will develop a research project, write an observing proposal, carry out the observations, reduce your data, and present your results as a scientific paper.

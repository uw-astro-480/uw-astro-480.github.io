# ARCSAT paper

## Contents

The goal of the ARCSAT observations is for you to produce a scientific-like paper that describes your observations and analysis. The format and contents of the paper are free but please, see the following guidelines:

- **The paper must be individually written** even if the observations were done in teams. You can do the data reduction of your data as a team but the analysis, conclusions, and writing must be done individually. You can discuss the analysis with your team but the final paper must be your own work.
- The paper must not be longer than 4 pages including figures and bibliography. You can use double column if necessary and a font size not smaller than 10pt. You can write the paper with any software you like (Word, LaTeX, etc.) but please make sure that the final product is a PDF. You must include figures and tables as needed in your paper.
- The paper must include a title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusions. You can rename the sections and organise them as you want but your writing must cover those points.
- In the paper you must discuss your observations, weather, technical issues, etc.
- The paper must describe the telescope and instrumentation used for the observations (including filters) and characterise the CCD (gain, readout noise, etc.).
- You must describe the data reductions in detail, issues found, potential improvements, etc.
- It is OK if you do not reach a result (e.g. if you conclude that it was not possible to determine the period of a variable star) as long as you describe why that is the case and what you would do to improve the analysis, or what additional data you would need to reach a conclusion.
- You must include the code that you used to reduce and analyse the data as a separate set of files. This can be a Jupyter Notebook or a series of Python files. The latter is preferred. The goal is to provide a set of scripts, properly commented, that could be used by someone else to reproduce your analysis. We will _not_ try to run your code but we will check that it is well documented and that it does all the steps that you describe in the paper.
- Your code must live in a repository that you created for this project in your personal GitHub account. Include a link to the repository in your paper.
- The code for the data reduction can be the same for everybody in the team but each person should create their own repository and include their own analysis code.

## Submission

The paper is due on **June 12th at 5pm PDT**. Please, submit your paper in [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1799617/assignments/10383453).

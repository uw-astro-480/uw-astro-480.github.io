<h1>Introductory concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#introductory-concepts" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section covers a series of introductory concepts that are important for the course and for observational astronomy in general. It is not intended to be thoroughly exhaustive, but rather to provide a basic understanding of the topics that will be covered in more detail later in the course. Further reading is provided at the end of the section and as links throughout the text.</p>
<section id="coordinate-systems">
<h2>Coordinate systems<a class="headerlink" href="#coordinate-systems" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Anybody who has spent some time looking at the sky in a dark place at night has noticed that the stars, planets, and other astronomical objects seem to be arranged on the “surface” of a sphere that rotates around a point. If we take a long-exposure photograph centred around that “celestial pole” we will see that the stars move in arcs.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-find-the-north-star-and-why-youd-want-to/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="North star traces" class="align-center" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/WindowsLiveWriterHowToFindTheNorthStarAndWhyYoudWantTo_E333070317-194557-6308_070317-203720-6344_3.jpg?w=600&amp;h=1260&amp;ssl=1" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, we understand why this is happening: the sky rotates as a result of the rotation of the Earth, with the Earth’s axis of rotation —when projected on the sky— defining the point around which the celestial sphere rotates. And the stars are not all really on the same plane, but rather at different distances from us. But those distances are so vast that perspective renders them all on a what appears to be a single surface.</p>
<p>That said, it is convenient for many purposes to think of the sky as a sphere that rotates around a given axis, and the celestial objects being placed on the surface of that sphere.</p>
<section id="definitions">
<h3>Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let’s start with some basic definitions. Imagine a spherical surface with unit radius. We draw a line that passes through the centre of the sphere, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> and intersects the surface at two points, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P'\)</span> which we will call the <em>poles</em>. Next we define a plane that passes through the centre of the sphere and is perpendicular to the line that connects the two poles. This plane intersects the surface of the sphere at a circle which we will call the <em>fundamental circle</em>.</p>
<p>Now let’s define a point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> on the surface of the sphere. We can draw a circle that passes through both poles and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> (note that this circle is centred on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>). This circle intersects the fundamental circle at a point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s now draw a circle that is parallel to the fundamental circle and intersects the surface of the sphere at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. Finally, let’s define another point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> on the fundamental circle.</p>

<p>The point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> can now be defined using two angles: the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\angle ACB\)</span> and the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\angle DCB\)</span>. We can also define and important concepts: a <em>great circle</em> is one defined by a plane that passes through the centre of the sphere. All great circles have equal length and are the largest possible circle than can be drawn on the sphere. A <em>small circle</em> is a circle defined on the sphere that is not a great circle. In our example above the circles <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PABP'\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PDP'\)</span> are great circles, as well as the fundamental circle. The circle that is parallel to the fundamental circle and passes through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is a small circle. The shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere is always along a great circle, a concept that is sometimes counter-intuitive. The length of a small circle that is parallel to the fundamental circle decreases with the cosine of the angle (e.g., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos(ACB)\)</span>).</p>

<section id="spherical-trigonometry">
<h3>Spherical trigonometry<a class="headerlink" href="#spherical-trigonometry" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Spherical trigonometry</em> is the branch of mathematics that studies with the relationships between angles and distances on the surface of a sphere. While many concepts may seem similar to planar (or Euclidean) trigonometry, there are important differences. Let’s start by defining a triangle from the intersection of three great circles:</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id3">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Angles on a spherical triangle are denoted with capital latin letters. In our case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> are the angles at the vertices of the triangle. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> (and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>) is the angle between the two planes that intersect the sphere at vertex <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. Angles are measured in radians</p>
<p>The sides of the triangle are also measured in radians and measured by the angle that it subtends at the centre. The sides are denoted with lower case letters, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> is the side opposite to angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> is the side opposite to angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> is the side opposite to angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>By definition a spherical triangle angle is less than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span> radians so</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\pi &lt; A+ B+ C &lt; 3\pi

<p>The most important rule of spherical trigonometry is the <em>law of cosines</em>. A proof of this law (and other relationships that we will see below) can be found in many textbooks on spherical astronomy, for example in Chapter 1 of Smart’s Textbook on Spherical Astronomy. The law of cosines applies to each angle so we can write three expressions such as:</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\cos a &amp;=&amp; \cos b \cos c + \sin b \sin c \cos A \\
\cos b &amp;=&amp; \cos a \cos c + \sin a \sin c \cos B \\
\cos c &amp;=&amp; \cos a \cos b + \sin a \sin b \cos C
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{split}\]</div>
</div>
<p>From the law of cosines we can derive the <em>law of sines</em>:</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\frac{\sin A}{\sin a} = \frac{\sin B}{\sin b} = \frac{\sin C}{\sin c}
\]</div>
</div>
<p>These two expressions are the base of spherical trigonometry can be used to derive any additional relationships. For right spherical triangles (triangles in which one angle is formed by the intersection of two perpendicular planes) we can also make use of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_trigonometry#Napier's_rules_for_right_spherical_triangles" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Napier’s rules</a> which we won’t cover here but that are essential for solving problems in astronomical spherical trigonometry, where many triangles are right triangles.</p>

<section id="separations-on-the-sphere">
<h4>Separations on the sphere<a class="headerlink" href="#separations-on-the-sphere" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>A typical problem in spherical trigonometry consists on measuring the distance (<em>separation</em>) between two points on the surface of a sphere. In particular, consider the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> in the following case:</p>

<p>As we will see, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> are defined using reference points that are natural in spherical coordinate systems.

We’ll leave the proof of this experiment to the reader (hint: consider the triangle defined by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm NCP}-B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(AB\)</span> great circles and the fundamental plane, and use the Napier’s rules).</p>

<section id="horizontal-coordinates">
<h3>Horizontal coordinates<a class="headerlink" href="#horizontal-coordinates" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The simplest type of coordinates is called horizontal (also altitude-azimuth or alt-az). Imagine that you are standing on the surface of the Earth in a place where you can all the way to the horizon. The point just above your head is called the <em>zenith</em>. The one just below your feet is called the <em>nadir</em>. These two points defined the poles of the horizontal coordinate system while the horizon is the fundamental circle. If we have a point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> on the sky, we can define its position with two coordinates: <em>altitude</em> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span>) and <em>azimuth</em> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>). Altitude is the simplest one and is just the angle, perpendicular to the horizon, between the horizon and the point. For the azimuth we need to define an arbitrary reference point on the horizon. We chose the North cardinal point (the direction of the North pole) and measure the angle from there, going clockwise (azimuth angles increase from North towards East).</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id5">

</figure>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>There is no strong convention on how to define the azimuth angle. Some people define it as the angle from the South cardinal point, going clockwise. When dealing with alt-az coordinates always make sure that you know how the azimuth angle is defined. Similarly, the letters <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> are not universally used to denote altitude and azimuth, respectively.</p>
</div>
<p>A critical thing to realise is that the horizontal coordinates of an object change during the night as the sky rotates. Because of that we need an additional datum, the time of observation, to fully define the position of such object. The coordinates of the object will also depend on the location of the observer on the Earth. Imagine an observer on the equator observing a star that is at the zenith. That observer will measure an altitude of 90 degrees. Now imagine an observer at the North (or South) pole observing the same star at the same time: they will measure an altitude of 0 degrees!</p>
<p>Before we move on, we can introduce a few additional concepts based on the horizontal coordinate system. The <em>zenith distance</em> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>) is the distance between the point we are trying to measure and the zenith. <em>Twilights</em> are defined as the moment in which the Sun reaches a certain point below the horizon. The most common definitions are <em>civil twilight</em> (when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon), <em>nautical twilight</em> (12 degrees below the horizon), and <em>astronomical twilight</em> (18 degrees below the horizon).</p>
</section>
<section id="equatorial-coordinates">
<h3>Equatorial coordinates<a class="headerlink" href="#equatorial-coordinates" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>While horizontal coordinates are easy to understand but are not practical to define the position of celestial object in a way that is independent of the observer’s location and time. For that we need to define a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the stars. The most common system that meets this requirement is the <em>equatorial coordinate system</em>.</p>
<p>As we did before, let’s imagine a celestial sphere, centred on the Earth, but in this case the poles will be the North and South celestial poles (NCP, SCP), that is, the points on the celestial sphere that are aligned with the Earth’s axis of rotation. The fundamental circle in this system is called the <em>celestial equator</em>. For a given point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> on the sphere we define its position with two angles: <em>declination</em> (Dec or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span>) and <em>right ascension</em> (RA or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>). The declination is measured from the celestial equator following the great circle that passes through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> and the poles (declination is positive towards the NCP). As with horizontal coordinates we now need to define a reference point for the right ascension. We chose the point on the celestial equator on which the Sun is at the vernal (Spring) equinox, which we call the <em>vernal point</em>. RA increases along the celestial equator clockwise when looking from the NCP. The units of RA are usually hours, minutes, and seconds (1 hour = 15 degrees) and declination is always measured in degrees.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id6">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since the sky rotates around the polar axis, the declination of an object never changes, and as the vernal point also rotates, the right ascension of the object is also constant. The equatorial coordinates of an object are fixed regardless of the observer’s location or time of observation (as we’ll see, things are a bit more complicated, but for now we can assume that this is true).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Technically the equatorial system that we have defined is called <em>Geocentric Celestial Reference System</em> since the centre of the coordinate system is assumed to be the centre of mass of the Earth. As we’ll see later, other equatorial systems can be defined with centres at other points, such as the barycentre of the Solar System.</p>
</div>
<p>We can put the horizontal and equatorial coordinate systems together in a single diagram to see how they relate to each other. Here the celestial equator and horizon form an angle equal to the latitude of the observer’s location on the Earth. The angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ZS\)</span> is the zenith distance and the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PS\)</span> along the great circle perpendicular to the celestial equator is the <em>hour angle</em>. The circle that passes through the zenith and the poles is called the <em>local meridian</em>.</p>

<h4>Hour angle<a class="headerlink" href="#hour-angle" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>We will more properly introduce sidereal time <a class="reference internal" href="#sidereal-time">later</a>, but for now let’s just define <em>local sidereal time</em> (LST) as the angle between the local meridian and the vernal point. LST is measured in hours and is zero when the vernal point crosses the local meridian.</p>
<figure class="align-center">

</a>

<p>We then define the <em>hour angle</em> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span>) as the angle between the local meridian and the object. From the diagram above it’s clear that the H and the LST are related by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H={\rm LST}-\alpha\)</span>. The hour angle is measured in hours and increases towards the West. Since an object on the sky will move from East to West, a negative hour angle indicates that the object is rising and a positive hour angle indicates that the object is setting. The hour angle is zero when the object crosses the local meridian, at which point the local sidereal time is the same as the right ascension of the object.</p>

<section id="precession-of-the-equinoxes">
<h3>Precession of the equinoxes<a class="headerlink" href="#precession-of-the-equinoxes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth causes it axis of rotation to wobble over time. The polar axis describes a circle on the celestial sphere with a period of about 26,000 years. This phenomenon is called <em>precession of the equinoxes</em>. The effect of the precession in the equatorial coordinate system is that as polar axis changes so does the celestial equator and the location of the vernal point (which is defined as one of the point in which the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator). Although the change due to precession may seem small, it is in the order of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sim 50\)</span> arcseconds per year, which is significant for many astronomical applications. This means that the equatorial coordinates of an object will change over time as the vernal point changes. To account for this effect, astronomers refer to the equatorial coordinates of an object at a given epoch. Most coordinates these days are referred to the position of the vernal point in the Julian date 2000 (usually referred as J2000) but older catalogues may use B1950 (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox_(celestial_coordinates)#Besselian_equinoxes_and_epochs" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Besselian epoch</a> 1950.0).</p>

<p>Additional effects such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">nutation</a> also affect the alignment of the celestial pole, but usually these effects are small enough that they can be ignored for most applications.</p>
<p>The inconvenience of the shifting of the vernal equinox has lead to the establishment of the <em>International Celestial Reference System</em> (ICRS) and other systems that are defined with respect to very stable reference points (usually distant radio sources). The ICRS is centred on the barycentre of the Solar System while the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS) is centred on the centre of mass of the Earth and is useful for calculating the position of near-Earth objects.</p>
<p>The ICRS is defined so that its orientation matches the direction of the vernal point in J2000 within approximately 23 milliarcseconds. Because of that, for most applications one can ignore differences between J200 and ICRS. These differences are important, however, when carrying out transformations to other coordinate systems.</p>

<section id="coordinate-transformations">
<h3>Coordinate transformations<a class="headerlink" href="#coordinate-transformations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We often need to transform from one coordinate system to another. Coordinate transformations can be derived using the basic rules of spherical trigonometry, and transformations between many common coordinate systems can be found in textbooks and online. By far the most common coordinate transformation is between equatorial and horizontal coordinates, which is especially useful when planning observations to determine the altitude of an object at the site of observation during the night. If we refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-eq-altaz">figure</a> relating equatorial and horizontal coordinates, we can write the following equations:</p>

<p>In line 3 with define the current time. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">astropy</span></code> defaults to using the UTC scale, but for the current time (and for most applications, see below) we don’t need to worry too much about that. In line 4 we define the location of the observatory. In this case we are using the internal list of locations that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">astropy</span></code> knows, but we could also define it from latitude, longitude, and altitude. Next we define the coordinates of our target. Note that we need to specify the units and the frame. Here we use the ICRS coordinate system, which is the default one for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SkyCoord</span></code>. As we have discussed, the difference between ICRS and J2000 is negligible and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">astropy</span></code> will take care of the conversion. This is fine of far away objects. However, for near-Earth objects like the Moon or planets things may be different!</p>
<p>In line 8 we define an alt-azimuthal frame using the time and location of the observer. This frame is not associated with a specific coordinate and just defined the orientation of the alt-az frame. In the following line is we actually transform the coordinates. Here <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">altaz</span></code> will be a new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SkyCoord</span></code> object but this time in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AltAz</span></code> frame.

<h2>Time<a class="headerlink" href="#time" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We move now to a closely related topic: the measurement of times and dates. During our discussion of coordinate systems we have already mentioned that the coordinates of an object, as seen from a location on Earth, depend on the time of observation, a concept that in the case of equatorial coordinates we encoded in the hour angle.</p>
<section id="solar-time">
<h3>Solar time<a class="headerlink" href="#solar-time" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first an most natural way to measure time is to look at the Sun, and as such many cultures have defined their calendars based on the position of the Sun in the sky. We can defined the <em>apparent solar day</em> (or <em>true solar day</em>) as the time measured by the successive passes of the Sun over the local median (which can be measured, for example, by looking at the shadow cast by a stick or <em>gnomon</em>). By a convention that we owe to the Egyptians we divide the solar day into 24 equal parts, or <em>hours</em>, and into smaller time units.</p>
<p>The problem with the apparent solar day is that the Sun does not move at a perfectly constant speed across the sky over a full year. This is due to two facts: the ellipticity of the Earth’s orbit and the tilt of the Earth’s axis with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The result is that the length of the solar day varies over the year: an apparent solar day in March is about 18 seconds short of 24 hours, while on in late December is longer by almost 30 seconds. To account for the variability in the true solar time we introduce the <em>mean solar day</em>, which moves at constant speed. Mean solar time can be defined as the time measured by a fictitious Sun that moves at constant speed along the celestial equator and coincides with the true Sun at the perigee and apogee.</p>
<p>The difference between the mean solar time and the apparent solar time is called the <em>equation of time</em>. The equation of time is a periodic function, which resets over the period of a year (i.e., the difference between true time and mean time does not accumulate past a year).</p>

<p>These days the mean solar time is defined based on the position of far away sources using very long baseline interferometry, and as such a mean solar day is 24.0000006 hours (based on the SI definition of a second).</p>
<p>The solar mean time needs to be measured with respect to a given location on Earth, which for historical reason is chosen to the the Greenwich meridian (and as such called the <em>Greenwich Mean Time</em> or GMT, also often referred as <em>Universal Time</em> or UT). The time at a given location is then defined as the difference between the local mean solar time and the GMT based on the latitude of the place</p>

<section id="dynamical-time">
<h3>Dynamical time<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamical-time" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The mean solar time is not a perfect measure of time. The rotation of the Earth is not constant and is affected by many factors, such as the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, the tides, and the motion of the Earth’s crust. To account for these variations we need to define a new time scale, called <em>dynamical time</em>. Dynamical time has had multiple iterations over the years, from the original Ephemeris Time or ET to the Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT) or the current <em>Terrestrial Time</em> (TT). In all cases the dynamical time unit is the SI second. Dynamical time definitions are complex but they are designed to be free of the variations that affect the mean solar time.</p>
<p>Starting in 1970 a new time, the <em>International Atomic Time</em> (TAI) was introduced based on the combined measurements of over 450 atomic clocks distributed around the world. At the time of its inception TAI was defined to be (and remains) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm TAI=TT-32.184\,s\)</span>.</p>
<p>Universal Time (UT or GMT) differs from TT or TAI by a factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta T\)</span> such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(UT=TT - \Delta T\)</span>. The value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta T\)</span> cannot be predicted over a long period of time as it depends on precise measurements of the Earth’s Orientation Parameter, which are released by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Home/home_node.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service</a> (in reality IERS releases the value of <em>DUT1</em>, a closely related concept). The following image shows the variation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta T\)</span> over the years.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id11">

</figure>
<p>Since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta T\)</span> is a complicated function of time, a new time was introduced the UTC or <em>Coordinated Universal Time</em> which has an offset with respect to TAI that is an integer number of seconds. Given that the rate of rotation of the Earth is continuously decreasing due to the influence of the Moon, UTC keeps diverging from TAI. By convention the difference between UTC and TAI is kept within 0.9 seconds by introducing <em>leap seconds</em> when necessary. Currently <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm UTC=TAI-37\,s\)</span>. UTC is commonly referred as the <em>Civil Time</em> and is the one used for most applications, including astronomical observations. It is important, however, to know what time scale we are using and whether it is the appropriate one for our purposes. Many astronomical libraries like <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/time/index.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">astropy.time</a> allow to convert between different time scales and are able to query the IERS Bulletins for updated values of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta T\)</span> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DUT1</span></code> parameters.</p>

<h3>Sidereal time<a class="headerlink" href="#sidereal-time" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have already introduced the concept of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sidereal</span> <span class="pre">time</span></code>, but let’s define it properly now. So far our definition of day and time has been based (albeit mostly from a historical perspective) in the successive transits of the Sun over the local median. However, if we were to do the same exercise using a distant star (say, Deneb, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\ \rm Cyg\)</span>), a precise watch would measure that the time between two consecutive transits is less than 24 hours (about 23 hours and 56 minutes).</p>
<p>The reason is that in the time between the two transits the Earth has moved a bit along its orbit around the Sun. Since the Earth completes an orbit around the Sun in approximately 365 days, the Earth moves a bit under a degree in one day, or about 4 minutes.</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sidereal-time-solar-standard-dr-m-elangovan" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="../../_images/sidereal-time.png" src="../../_images/sidereal-time.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>The sidereal time is defined based on the movement of the vernal equinox (or any fixed point on the celestial sphere). As with the apparent solar time, the sidereal time is affected by the ellipticity and inclination of the Earth’s orbit. Because of this a <em>mean sidereal time</em> (MST) is analogously defined. The mean sidereal time refers to the the time measured at the Greenwich meridian; the <em>local sidereal time</em> (LST) is related to the MST by the longitude of the location, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm LST} = {\rm MST} - {\rm longitude}\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Julian dates<a class="headerlink" href="#julian-dates" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Julian date</em> (JD) is a continuous count of days and fractions of days since the beginning of the Julian Period at 12h UT on January 1, 4713 BC. The Julian date is widely used in astronomy because it provides a simple and unambiguous way to specify dates and times. A Julian day is defined as 86,400 SI seconds, which is the same as a mean solar day. Note that Julian dates change at noon UT unlike civil time. For example, the Julian date corresponding to 12h UT on April 10th 2025 is 2460776.0.</p>

<p>As you can see, the units we typically use for for wavelength change depending on the type of radiation we are studying. Wavelength and frequency are related as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu=c/\lambda\)</span>. Traditionally astronomers have used wavelength units for optical and infrared radiation, while radio astronomers use frequency units. In the case of X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy, both units are used.</p>
<p>Astronomers have many ways to quantify the amount of electromagnetic radiation emitted by an object. We can defined the <em>specific intensity</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I_\nu\)</span> (sometime called radiance) as the energy emitted by a surface per unit of area per unit of time per unit of frequency (or wavelength) and per unit of solid angle. The units of specific intensity are watts per steradian per square metre per hertz (or, in CGS, ergs per square centimetre per steradian per hertz per second). For an angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> that is measured from the normal to the surface</p>

<p>The <em>monochromatic flux</em> (also called <em>brightness</em> or irradiance) is the amount of energy that passes through a unit surface from all directions</p>

<h2>Magnitudes<a class="headerlink" href="#magnitudes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The quantities defined in the previous section express the amount of light emitted by a source. Astronomers, however, tend to use a different system to measure flux (brightness): <em>magnitudes</em>. The magnitude system was first defined by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC. In this system start of magnitude 1 are the first ones visible to the naked eye just after sunset, while the faintest starts visible at the end of the twilight are of magnitude 6. Intermediate magnitudes were defined by dividing the twilight in equal parts. The magnitude system remained in used for many centuries and, while imprecise, it was not until the advent of photography and detectors that could measure light more quantitatively that the system was redefined.</p>
<p>The modern magnitude system takes into account that the human eye responds to stimuli in an approximately <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">logarithmic way</a>. From that, the difference in <em>apparent magnitude</em> between two sources is defined as proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of their fluxes:</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
m_1 - m_2 \propto \log_{10}\left( \dfrac{F_1}{F_2} \right)
\]</div>
</div>
<p>In the 19th century the English astronomer Pogson further refined this definition by requiring a start of magnitude 6 to be 100 times fainter than one of magnitude 1. This is equivalent to</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \log_{10}\left( \dfrac{F_1}{F_2} \right)
\]</div>
</div>
<p>and also equivalent to saying that a star of magnitude 2 is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100^{1/5}\approx2.512\)</span> times fainter than a star of magnitude 1. Note the minus sign that is encodes the fact that larger magnitudes mean fainter sources. Apparent magnitudes defined this way are called <em>Pogson magnitudes</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Pogson magnitudes are always defined using photon fluxes.</p>
</div>
<p>Apparent magnitudes are defined for a given passband or wavelength range (more on this later). <em>Bolometric magnitudes</em> account for the electromagnetic flux received from a source in all wavelengths. The difference between the apparent magnitude in a bandpass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\)</span> and the total bolometric magnitude is called the <em>bolometric correction</em>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm BC}_X\)</span> and is defined as</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
{\rm BC}_X = m_{\rm bol} - m_X
\]</div>
</div>
<p>In practice bolometric magnitudes are very difficult to measure and the bolometric correction is usually estimated from the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source, which are in turn determined from models for a given astronomical object (for example, for a start of a certain spectral type).</p>
<p>The <em>absolute magnitude</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> is defined as the apparent magnitude of a source at a distance of 10 parsecs. It is related to the apparent magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> and the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> (in parsecs) to the source by</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
m - M = 5 \log_{10} d - 5
\]</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, the <em>absolute bolometric magnitude</em> is directly related to the luminosity of a source using the solar luminosity as a reference:</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
M_{\rm bol} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \dfrac{L}{L_\odot} \right) + 4.74
\]</div>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_\odot\)</span> is the luminosity of the Sun. The absolute bolometric magnitude is a measure of the total energy emitted by a source and is independent of distance.</p>
<section id="photometric-systems">
<h3>Photometric systems<a class="headerlink" href="#photometric-systems" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>So far all the the apparent magnitudes we have defined have been in reference to another magnitude, that is to the ratio of their fluxes. We can do</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
m - m_0 = -2.5 \log_{10}\left( \dfrac{F}{F_0} \right)
m = -2.5 \log_{10} F + C(\lambda)
\]</div>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(\lambda)\)</span> is called a <em>zero-point</em> and refers to the flux that corresponds to a magnitude of 0 for a given wavelength. The choice and characterisation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C(\lambda)\)</span> is what define a <em>photometric system</em>.</p>
<p>Historically most photometric systems where defined so that the zero-point corresponds to the flux of Vega at each wavelength, and as such are called VEGAMAG systems. Later the average spectrum of a group of A0V stars such as Vega was used. Vega was used as a reference for two reasons: it’s one of the brightest stars on the sky and A-type stars have relatively smooth, well understood spectra.</p>
<p>One of the most common photometric systems, the UBVRI system or Johnson can be defined for each bandpass as</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
m_{UBVRI} = -2.5 \log_{10}\dfrac{\int_{UBVRI}F_{UBVRI}\lambda d\lambda}{\int_{UBVRI}F_{UBVRI}({\rm Vega})\lambda d\lambda}
\]</div>
</div>
<p>where the integrals are over the bandpass of the filter and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> factor is included to convert from flux to photon flux.</p>
<p>A conceptually different photometric system is the AB magnitude system. Here we assume a constant zero-point flux <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{0,\nu}=3631\, {\rm Jy}\)</span> which is the flux density of Vega at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5500\,\unicode{x212B}\)</span> in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jansky" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Jankys</a>. With this</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
m_{AB}=-2.5\log_{10} F_\nu-48.6
\]</div>
</div>
<p>when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_\nu\)</span> is in Jy. Normally we defined an AB magnitude for a certain filter bandpass so that</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[

\]</div>
</div>
<p>where again the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\nu\)</span> factor is included to convert from flux to photon flux.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/acs/data-analysis/zeropoints" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">STMAG</a> zero-point system makes similar assumptions to the AB system but for a constant flux per unit of wavelength and was developed primarily for the Hubble Space Telescope bandpasses.</p>
<p>Why are AB and STMAG systems not the one primarily used? While much more simpler to define, the AB and STMAG systems are not based on a real source (there are no sources with a constant flux density) and as such they are more difficult to calibrate. However the most common modern photometric systems are either based on the AB system or have been cross-calibrated and allow for a direct comparison with it.</p>

<h3>Colours<a class="headerlink" href="#colours" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>colour index</em> or just colour is the difference between two magnitudes in different bandpasses. In this case the colour corresponds to the ratio of fluxes (a concept that is closely related to the usual definition of “colour”). For a VEGAMAG system, the colour gives the ratio of the fluxes relative to the ration of the fluxes of an A0V star.</p>

<section id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a class="headerlink" href="#filters" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Photometric systems are usually defined for a set of well-defined filters, each one letting pass only a certain range of wavelengths, and with a known transmission curve. The following figure shoes the transmission curves of several common photometric systems/filter sets. Often the filters (e.g., the SDSS system) were developed for a specific telescope and project but have since become widely used.</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://astroweb.case.edu/ssm/ASTR620/mags.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="../../_images/filters.png" src="../../_images/filters.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>Photometric systems are often defined in terms of their effective central wavelength and the equivalent width of the filter. The equivalent width is defined as that of a rectangular filter with 100% transmission centred around the effective wavelength.</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ARA&amp;A..43..293B" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="../../_images/filters-table.png" src="../../_images/filters-table.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>These filters are usually called “broadband” because they have non-zero transmission over a wide range of wavelengths (hundreds or thousands of angstroms). There are also “narrow-band” filters, which have a much narrower transmission range (typically 10-100 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\unicode{x212B}\)</span>) and are used to isolate specific spectral lines. Typical narrow-band filters are H<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> [OII], [OIII], [SII], etc. For extragalactic targets the recession velocity of the source needs to be taken into account as the emission line of interest may have been red- or blue-shifted. Because of that narrow-band filters are often produced in sets to cover a range of central wavelengths.</p>

<h2>Optics and telescopes<a class="headerlink" href="#optics-and-telescopes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>While for millennia we relied only on our eyes to observe the sky, the development of optics, and in particular of telescopes, soon revolutionised astronomy. Telescopes allow us to collect more light and to resolve finer details than the human eye alone. Here we will very briefly discuss some of the basic concepts surrounding optics and telescopes.</p>
<section id="basic-principles">
<h3>Basic principles<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-principles" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The basic principle of classic optics is Snell’s law, which relates the angles of incidence and refraction of light passing through the boundary between two different media.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id12">

<p>Snell’s law can be expressed as</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
n\sin i = n^\prime \sin i^\prime
\]</div>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n^\prime\)</span> are the indices of refraction of the two media, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> is the angle of incidence, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i^\prime\)</span> is the angle of refraction. The index of refraction is defined as the ratio between the speed of light in vacuum and the speed of light in the medium. The angles are measured with respect to the normal to the surface.</p>
<p>Snell’s law can also be used to describe the reflection of light. In this case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=n^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i=-i^\prime\)</span> (the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection).</p>
<p>Snell’s law is a special case of Fermat’s principle, which states that light travelling between two points will follow the path that can be travelled in the least time.</p>

<section id="paraxial-approximation-and-thin-lenses">
<h3>Paraxial approximation and thin lenses<a class="headerlink" href="#paraxial-approximation-and-thin-lenses" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>paraxial approximation</em> in optics assumes that the angles of incidence and refraction on a surface as small, so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\ll1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sin i\approx i\)</span>. In this regime many of the equations of optics can be simplified and the behaviour of light can be described using simple geometric optics. We can also disregard most <a class="reference internal" href="#aberrations">aberrations</a> while we are close to the optical axis. The paraxial approximation is usually combined with the <em>thin lens approximation</em>, which assumes that the thickness of the lens is small compared to its focal length (which we’ll describe in a second). In this case we can treat the lens as a single surface. For now we will also ignore the effects of diffraction, which is usually ok when the aperture of the lens is very large compared to the wavelength of the light.</p>
<p>Let’s consider two cases of thin lenses: one with a convex surface (top) and one with a concave surface (bottom).</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.jobilize.com/physics3/course/2-4-thin-lenses-geometric-optics-and-image-formation-by-openstax?page=1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="../../_images/ray-tracing.png" src="../../_images/ray-tracing.png" style="width: 100%;" />

<p>First we’ll define a few concepts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">meridional</span> <span class="pre">ray</span></code> is one that is limited to the plane formed by the optical axis of the system and the point on which the ray originated. All rays of interest in this section are meridional rays.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chief</span> <span class="pre">ray</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">principal</span> <span class="pre">ray</span></code> is one that starts at the edge of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">object</span></code> that emits the ray and passes through the centre of the optical element (in reality it’s the ray that passes through the centre of the aperture stop, but as we’ll see that usually means the same thing). If the lens is symmetric —both surfaces have the same but opposite curvature— the chief ray passes through the centre of the lens without deflection (really the light “bends” twice, once at each surface, but the net effect is no deflection).</p></li>
<li><p>The distance between the lens to the object (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_o\)</span>) and to the image (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_i\)</span>) are called the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conjugate</span> <span class="pre">distances</span></code>. Note that in case a) the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_i&gt;0\)</span> but <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_o&lt;0\)</span> while in case b) both distances are negative.</p></li>
<li><p>The point where a ray that is parallel to the optical axis intersects the optical axis is called the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">focal</span> <span class="pre">point</span></code> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span>) and the distance between the lens and the focal point is called the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">focal</span> <span class="pre">length</span></code> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>). The focal length is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. For an object at an infinite distance (as is the case, in excellent approximation, for astronomical sources) the focal point defines the point where all the rays coming from the object converge.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">image</span></code> is the point where the optical rays converge after passing through the lens. The image is real if the rays actually converge at a point and virtual if they only appear to converge at a point (i.e., the rays diverge after passing through the lens). In a converging lens the image is real (the rays actually converge) while in a diverging lens the image is virtual (the rays diverge after passing through the lens) and located in the place where the back-propagation of the rays converge. However, whether an image is real or virtual depends on the position of the object with respect to the lens. For example, if we place an object at a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_o\)</span> from a converging lens, the image will be real if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_o&gt;f\)</span> and virtual if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_o&lt;f\)</span>. The opposite is true for diverging lenses.</p></li>

<p>From simple geometric relationships (see, for example Schroeder, Astronomical Optics, Ch. 2) we can derive the following expression for a single refracting surface:</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\dfrac{n^\prime}{d_i}-\dfrac{n}{d_o}=\dfrac{n^\prime-n}{R}
\]</div>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> is the radius of curvature of the surface, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is the index of refraction of the medium where the object is located, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n^\prime\)</span> is the index of refraction of the lens. The right side of this equation is called the <em>power</em> of the lens and is independent of the positions of the object and image. The power defines the ability of the lens to converge or diverge light. The power of the lens is related to the focal length by</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
P \equiv \dfrac{(n^\prime-n)}{R}=\dfrac{n}{f}=\dfrac{n^\prime}{f^\prime}
\]</div>
</div>
<p>However, lenses are formed by two surfaces. In this case we can write the power as</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
P=\dfrac{1}{f^\prime}=(n^\prime-1)\left(\dfrac{1}{R_1}-\dfrac{1}{R_2}\right)
\]</div>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/f^\prime=1/f_1+1/f_2\)</span> is the equivalent focal length of the system and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_2\)</span> are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces. Here we assume that the lens is thin and that the medium in which it is located has <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n^\prime\approx1\)</span> (as is the case for air). <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n^\prime\)</span> is the index of refraction of the lens material.</p>
<p>For the case of reflection we have a single surface. In this situation we can write that</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\dfrac{1}{d_i}+\dfrac{1}{d_o}=\dfrac{2}{R}
\]</div>
</div>
<p>and the focal length of a mirror is given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f=R/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can define the <em>focal ratio</em> or <em>f-number</em> of a lens or mirror as the focal length divided by the diameter of the aperture. In astronomy, for a fixed aperture, the f-number is a measure of how fast the beam of light is converging. Because of this, optical systems with a small f-number are called <em>fast</em> and those with a large f-number are called <em>slow</em>.</p>
<p>Another important concept is that of the <em>magnification</em> of an optical system. The magnification is defined as the ratio between the size of the image and the size of the object.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id14">

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
M=\dfrac{h^\prime}{h}=\dfrac{s^\prime-R}{s-R}=\dfrac{ns^\prime}{ns}
\]</div>
</div>
<p>(note that if the magnification is negative the image is inverted).</p>
<p>However, for the most usual case in astronomy, the object is at an infinite distance, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=\infty\)</span>, and the magnification is zero (this does not mean that a telescope cannot magnify an object at an infinite distance, it just means that the image is formed at the focal plane of the lens, but other optical elements placed before or after the focus can magnify the image). Instead, a more relevant concept is that of the <em>scale</em>, which is the smallest separation between two points that can be resolved by the optical system. The scale is defined as</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
S=\dfrac{1}{f}=\dfrac{206265}{f\,[\rm mm]}\,[\rm arcsec/mm]

<p>Finally, let’s consider the case of two plane-parallel plates of glass with thickness <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> and index of refraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>. This optical element does not change the magnification of a system, but it introduces a shift in the image position. The shift is given by</p>

<h3>Telescopes<a class="headerlink" href="#telescopes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A telescope is an optical system designed to collect light from a distant source (i.e., one that we can consider at infinite distance for optical purposes). The simplest telescopes, first built in the early 17th century, consisted of just an objective lens and an eyepiece. The objective lens is usually a converging element and determines the amount of light from the source that we can collect, while the eyepiece can be either converging (if located after the focal point of the objective) or diverging (if located before).</p>
<p>While simple, refracting telescopes have a number of problems, such as chromatic aberration (which we’ll discuss shortly). Constructing large refracting telescopes is also difficult, an in practice the largest refracting telescope, the Yerkes Observatory telescope, is only slightly over 1 metre in diameter.</p>
<p>The solution to these problem was found in 1666 by Isaac Newton (although the concept of magnifying images using curved mirrors goes back at least to the 11th century). The objective lens can be replaced by a concave mirror (usually parabolic) which focuses the light on the eyepiece.

<p>Most reflecting telescopes consist of two mirrors: a large primary mirror that collects the light, and a smaller secondary mirror that reflects it to a focus. The Newtonian telescope uses a flat secondary that just moves the focus to the side of the telescope, where an eyepiece or camera can be placed. The Cassegrain telescope uses a parabolic primary and a convex hyperbolic secondary placed before the focus of the primary. Another common design is the Gregorian telescope, which replaces the secondary with a concave ellipsoid.</p>

<p>In some cases, such as the Schmidt-Cassegrain or the Maksutov telescopes, an spherical mirror is used for ease of manufacturing. These telescopes suffer from significant spherical aberration which is compensated by using a special corrector plate in front of the primary mirror. Amateur telescopes often use this design because of its compactness and relatively lower price, but constructing corrector plates for large apertures soon becomes prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>Most modern telescopes use a Ritchey–Chrétien design, with hyperbolic primary and secondary mirrors. This design removes most low-order aberrations at the cost of being more difficult to manufacture. Additional optical defects are usually corrected by using a set of <em>corrector lenses</em> near the focal plane. Placing the corrector near the focus allows for it to be smaller and lighter, but since the beam of light is converging, the corrector is usually harder to design and manufacture.</p>

The secondary mirror can be seen at the top of the telescope, supported by the truss structure. The <em>Cassegrain focus</em> is located behind the primary mirror (which has a hole to allow the light to pass). Alternative foci can be created by placing a third, flat mirror, just behind the primary. This mirror moves the focus to one or more <em>Nasmyth foci</em> located at the sides of the telescope. The advantage of the Nasmyth foci or “port” is that the instruments do not need to move with the telescope, which simplifies engineering and improves instrument stability.

<section id="mounts">
<h4>Mounts<a class="headerlink" href="#mounts" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Telescopes need to be mounted on a structure that allows to point them to a desired location on the sky and, most importantly, to track that position as the Earth rotates. There are two main types of mounts: <em>alt-azimuthal</em> and <em>equatorial</em>.</p>
<p>The alt-azimuthal (or alt-az) mount has two axes of rotation, one that moves the telescope up and down (altitude) and another that moves it coplanar with the horizon (azimuth). Note that this are the same axes as the alt-az coordinates.</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="white-background reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/altaz-telescope.png"><img alt="../../_images/altaz-telescope.png" class="white-background" src="../../_images/altaz-telescope.png" style="width: 50%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>The advantage of the alt-az design is that is simple and that the centre of mass of the telescope is just above the mount, which makes it more stable. The disadvantage is that the telescope needs to be moved in two dimensions to track a source. Additionally, the even if we track a source on the sky by appropriately moving both axes, the field of view of the telescope will rotate. This is called <em>field rotation</em> and is caused by the fact that the field of view is not a single point. As the sky rotates, only the centre of the field of view is stationary, the rest of the field rotates around it. To compensate for this, the field needs to be rotated (or “de-rotated”) during the observation. This is done by a mechanism called the <em>rotator</em>, which depending on the telescope may move just the an optical element in the instrument, or rotate the entire back of the telescope.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id20">
<a class="white-background reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/rotator-gtc.png"><img alt="../../_images/rotator-gtc.png" class="white-background" src="../../_images/rotator-gtc.png" style="width: 100%;" />

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A solution to these problems is the use of an <em>equatorial mount</em>. In this case one of the axes of rotation (right ascension) is aligned with the Earth’s axis of rotation (i.e., points to the celestial pole). This means that we only need to move one axis to track a source on the sky. The other axis (declination) is used to point the telescope to a desired location on the sky.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of the equatorial mount is that the weight of the telescope is often misaligned with the mount, which requires it to be over-engineered to avoid vibrations. In practice, an unless the polar alignment is perfect, the telescope will still need to be moved in two axes to track a source, although the contribution of the declination axis is usually small. Similarly, equatorial mounts are usually affected by a small amount of field rotation, which may or may not need to be corrected depending on the length of the observation, instrumentation, scale, etc.</p>

</a>
</figure>
<p>Nowadays most large telescopes are build with alt-az mounts, and the problems of two-axis tracking and field rotation are solved by the use of guiding cameras and a closed-loop control system that continuously monitors the location of the telescope and adjust the position of all the axes.</p>

<section id="aberrations">
<h3>Aberrations<a class="headerlink" href="#aberrations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>So far we have limited ourselves to the paraxial and thing lens approximations. In reality, however, lenses and mirrors are not perfect. <em>Aberrations</em> arise when the image formed by an optical system is not a perfect representation of the object. There are many types of aberrations: chromatic, coma, spherical, … We will briefly discuss the most common ones below.</p>
<p>Aberrations can be avoided or compensated by taking into account Fermat’s principle: light travels between two points along the path that takes the least time. However, it is often not possible to derive a closed-form solution for the path of light rays in an optical system, and the behaviour of these systems needs to be studied using ray tracing and numerical methods.</p>
<section id="chromatic-aberration">
<h4>Chromatic aberration<a class="headerlink" href="#chromatic-aberration" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The simplest type of aberration is the chromatic aberration. This is caused by the fact that the index of refraction of a medium depends on the wavelength of the light passing through it. In practice this causes light of different wavelengths (colours) to be focused at different distances from the lens.</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="white-background reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/aberration-chromatic.png"><img alt="../../_images/aberration-chromatic.png" class="white-background" src="../../_images/aberration-chromatic.png" style="width: 50%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>Chromatic aberration is much less prevalent in mirrors, although it is still present in some cases. In lenses this aberration can be reduced by using a combination of lenses made of different materials (called <em>achromatic doublets</em> or <em>triplets</em>). The complexity of these designs is one of the reasons why large refracting telescopes are so expensive to build. However, chromatic aberration and achromatic elements are important in other optical systems, such as cameras and spectrographs, which use lenses as part of their design.</p>

<section id="spherical-aberration">
<h4>Spherical aberration<a class="headerlink" href="#spherical-aberration" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Spherical aberration is caused by perfectly spherical lenses or mirrors. As we move aways from the optical axis and the paraxial regime, the rays of light are not focused at the same point. This results in a series of concentric rings of light, which is called a <em>circle of confusion</em>.</p>

<h4>Coma<a class="headerlink" href="#coma" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>

<section id="astigmatism">
<h4>Astigmatism<a class="headerlink" href="#astigmatism" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Astigmatism is caused by the fact that the lens or mirror has different focal lengths for different orientations of the optical element. This means that a point source will be focused into an ellipse instead of a point. The effect is similar to coma, but the direction of the elongation of the ellipse depends on the orientation of the lens.</p>

<section id="diffraction">
<h4>Diffraction<a class="headerlink" href="#diffraction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Although not technically an aberration, we will briefly discuss the effect of diffraction here. Diffraction is the bending of light, without changes to its energy, when the light passes through and aperture or obstacle. In optical systems the edges of mirrors or lenses can act as sources of diffraction. So far we have assumed that the wavelength of the light is much smaller than the aperture of the mirror, but in practice diffraction establishes the maximum resolution of the optical system, i.e., the smallest separation between two point sources that can be resolved.</p>
<p>It can be shown (see Schroeder, Astronomical Optics) that the diffraction limit of a circular aperture is given by</p>
<div class="math-wrapper docutils container">
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
R[\rm rad] = \dfrac{\lambda}{D}
\]</div>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> is the resolution in radians, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is the wavelength of the light, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> is the diameter of the aperture. For a one-metre telescope observing at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5000\,\unicode{x212B}\)</span>, the resolution is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.1\)</span> arcseconds, which is less than what we be observed by ground-based telescopes due to atmospheric turbulence. In space, however, diffraction is often the limiting factor in the resolution of an optical telescope.</p>
<p>As we move to longer wavelengths the effect of diffraction becomes more important. The same telescope observing in the J band (1.25 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu \rm m\)</span>) has a resolution of about 0.25 arcseconds, while in the radio band (1 cm) the resolution is about 0.5 <strong>degrees</strong>. This means that radio telescopes need to be much larger than optical telescopes to achieve the same resolution.</p>
</section>
<section id="seeing">
<h4>Seeing<a class="headerlink" href="#seeing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Another not-quite-an-aberration effect that affects ground-based telescopes is the <em>seeing</em>. Astronomical seeing is the perturbation of the light by the turbulence of air cells in the atmosphere and it’s usually the main factor limiting the resolution of ground-based telescopes. Seeing changes in relatively short timescales as the turbulence in the atmosphere changes. To first order, seeing has the effect of blurring the image of a point source into a Gaussian-like shape (sometimes a Lorentzian profile is more accurate). Because of this we often measure the seeing as the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_width_at_half_maximum" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Full-Width at Half Maximum</a> (FWHM) of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">point spread function</a> (PSF) of a star.</p>
<p>Astronomical observatories are located at high altitudes and in dry locations to reduce the effect of seeing. The best ground-based observatories often reach seeings of 0.2-0.3 arcseconds but often the seeing is worse than that and a seeing of 1 arcsec or more is common for many professional telescopes.</p>
<p>Seeing is a function of the altitude of the object on the sky, with the lowest seeing occurring when the object is at the zenith (and the light of the object has to pass through the least amount of atmosphere). The seeing can be related to the <em>airmass</em>, which is normally defined as the secant of the zenith angle of the object, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X=\sec z=\sec (90-h)=\csc h\)</span>. With that definition, we can often approximate the seeing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\sim s_0 X^{3/5}\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_0\)</span> is the seeing at the zenith.</p>
</section>
<section id="adaptive-optics">
<h4>Adaptive optics<a class="headerlink" href="#adaptive-optics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The effect of seeing can sometimes be reduced by using <em>adaptive optics</em>. This technique uses a set of small mirrors that can be deformed to “undo” the effect of the seeing in the light wavefront. The mirrors are controlled by a computer that continuously monitors the image of a star and adjusts the shape of the mirrors to compensate for the distortion caused by the atmosphere. A wavefront sensor, usually located near the exit pupil, measured distortions in the wavefront and sends the information to a computer. This process is repeated many times per second.</p>
